Advent of Code 2023
https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1

My first attempt at advent of code as a Python beginner. Thought it would be an interesting use of my every growing knowledge as I learn to code.
It was very challenging at times and I nearly didnt finish it as got stuck on the very last bit - getting my code to recognise overlaps (like oneight being one + eight, not just one) - but i did it and it was very satisfying :)
